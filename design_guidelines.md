# Canara Bank Homepage Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Exact Figma Replication** - Do not redesign or restyle anything except the three specific modifications outlined below. Match the existing Figma design pixel-perfectly for all colors, typography, spacing, shadows, gradients, and layout.

## Color Scheme (From Figma)
- **Primary Blue:** #004B87
- **Secondary Yellow:** #F7BE00
- Use existing gradient combinations (blue-to-yellow) from Figma
- Maintain glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur exactly as designed

## Typography & Spacing
- Use existing typography scale from Figma (do not modify font families, sizes, or weights)
- Match existing spacing, card border radius, and button components exactly
- Maintain professional banking aesthetic throughout

## Required Modifications (ONLY These 3 Changes)

### 1. Header Logo Replacement
- Replace current circular "C" logo with provided Canara Bank triangle icon (blue/yellow)
- Keep identical size, padding, and alignment as existing logo
- Do not modify header colors, text, navigation, or layout

### 2. Loans Dropdown Update
Update existing "Loans" dropdown menu to show these options in exact order:
- Instant Loan
- Personal Loan
- Home Loan
- Education Loan
- Vehicle / Car Loan
- Business Loan
- Gold Loan

Maintain same styling: fonts, spacing, hover effects, and colors from existing dropdown.

### 3. Instant Loan Page (New Page)
Use SAME theme, components, and design system from Figma homepage.

**Hero Section:**

- Two buttons: "Apply Now" (primary), "Check Eligibility" (secondary)

**Eligibility Card (Right side or standalone component):**
- Customer ID or Registered Mobile (text input)
- Loan Amount (number input or slider)
- Loan Tenure (dropdown: 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 months)
- "Check Eligibility" button (primary)
- "Login to Continue" link/secondary button

**Information Sections (using homepage section styling):**
- Key Features (highlight benefits with icons)
- Eligibility Criteria (checklist format)
- Required Documents (list with icons)
- Interest & Charges (table or card layout)
- How It Works (4 steps with numbered progression)
- FAQs (3-5 collapsible accordion items)
- Disclaimer (small text): "Loan approval subject to bank policy. Never share OTP, PIN, or banking credentials."
